I'm the Director of Product at Syncromatics, but I've only ever written a few lines of code (and only when driven by a guidebook). I'm basically faking it, but at some level aren't we all? I'm excited to learn more about the entire process of collaboring on code and to have some fun hacking around this Hacktoberfest.
