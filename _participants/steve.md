I'm the Chief Product Officer at GMV Syncromatics, and have been participating with Hacktoberfest with the team for a few years. While my focus is on user-centric design and product-market fit, learning more about code is a lot of fun. I lead the Product and Design teams and work very closely with Engineering, Customer Success, and Marketing to deliver products to our customers.
